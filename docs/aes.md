# AES

AES (Advanced Encryrption Standard) is a symmetric key algorithm for data encryption. It is also known as Rijandel cipher. It was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2001. AES has been adopted by the U.S. government and it supersedes the [DES](/docs/des.md). It is efficient in both software and hardware. Most calculations are done in a particular finite field.

## Encryption and Decryption

Both encryption and decryption was done according to the official [AES documentation](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf).
